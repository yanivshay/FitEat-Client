# FitEat-Client Side
Final year college - Bsc computer science project

The front part of the final project.

FitEat is a web app that helps anyone reach their goals in a simple and easy way, with close monitoring of the system and support from the development team in the event of a failure.
The system is free of charge and provides fun nutrition throughout.

**The app uses a genetic algorithm** that builds an optimal menu for the customer to bring it to the goals and objectives it has set for itself.

This is done by enlarging a database containing a wide range of menus to allow the user to get varied menus at different calorie targets, and allowing users to edit the menus they received if they were not happy with what they were offered.
